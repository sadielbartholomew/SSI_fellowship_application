/In one sentence:/

Educated in physics, for the past four years I have been working as an effective
RSE in the field of climate and weather, under two different roles,
contributing widely to open-source software.

I completed an _Integrated Masters in Physics_ at _Durham University_. There:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 0.8em">
- I first learnt to program (=Hello World!=), in the language I still use above all
  today, Python;
- a final-year project in computational particle physics using C++ activated
  my interest in software for research, openness of research artefacts and HPC.

*** My first software role

My first step onto the RSE career ladder was to join the
_Met Office_ as a _Scientific Software Engineer_.

I spent two years in that role contributing to open-source Python-based
infrastructure libraries used to configure and run models for both
operational forecasting and research.


*** My next, and present, software role
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #78A8E2 15%, #ffffff 100%)
   :END:

For approaching two years I have been working as a _Computational Scientist_
for the Computational Modelling Services (CMS)
group within the _National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)_,
based at the Department of Meteorology at _University of Reading_.

*** Furthermore

I enjoy contributing to open-source software in a personal capacity,
for example:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:60%; font-size: 0.8em">
- as a [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@sadielbartholomew][volunteer reviewer]] for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS);
- with annual completion of the Hacktoberfest initiative (2018+);
- developing and publicising personal coding projects, e.g.
  [[https://github.com/sadielbartholomew/creative-matplotlib][=creative-matplotlib=]].

* What do I do in my current role?
