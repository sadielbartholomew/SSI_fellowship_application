/In one sentence:/

Educated in physics, for the past four years I have been working as an effective
RSE in the field of climate and weather, under two different roles,
contributing widely to open-source software.


*** Before my career

I completed an _Integrated Masters in Physics_ at _Durham University_. There:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 0.8em">
- I first learnt to program (=Hello World!=), in the language I still use above all
  today, Python;
- a final-year project in computational particle physics using C++ activated
  my interest in software for research, openness of research artefacts and HPC.

*** My first software role

   :END:

My first step onto the RSE career ladder was to join the
_Met Office_ as a _Scientific Software Engineer_.

I spent two years in that role contributing to open-source Python-based
infrastructure libraries used to configure and run models for both
operational forecasting and research.


*** My next, and present, software role
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #78A8E2 15%, #ffffff 100%)
   :END:

For approaching two years I have been working as a _Computational Scientist_
for the Computational Modelling Services (CMS)
group within the _National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)_,
based at the Department of Meteorology at _University of Reading_.

*** Furthermore
   :PROPERTIES:

I enjoy _contributing to open-source software in a personal capacity_,
for example:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:60%; font-size: 0.8em">
- as a volunteer reviewer for the Journal of Open Source Software;
- with annual completion of the Hacktoberfest initiative (2018+);
- by developing and publicising personal coding projects such
  as =creative-matplotlib= and =ocean-chroma-theme=.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="./media/videos/rotation_of_fractioned_circles_uniform.gif" /> 
#+END_EXPORT
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

* What do I do in my current role?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #E48181 15%, #ffffff 100%)

TODO.


* What are my plans for the fellowship?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #70C2BF 15%, #ffffff 100%)
   :END:
TODO.


* Thank you for your consideration

These slides were written in =org-mode= for =Emacs= and exported to
=reveal.js= using the =org-reveal= tool.

The corresponding code and content is all contained in
a private GitHub repository which I will make public and share if
I am selected for a fellowship (I could even use it as part of a feature on
presentation prepartion  in the "To be an RSE" videos).
